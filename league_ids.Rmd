Add new leagues here

need to worry about leagues that haven't started yet (and thus don't have a last game). Or maybe I don't.

keep track (until prior sorted) of last year's league also (as a comment?)

having at least one vector in id makes it a list-column

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
league_ids=tribble(
  ~the_country, ~id,
  "Scotland", 53513,
  "England",  53145,
  "England_champ", 53782,
  "France", 53638,
  "Greece", c(53558, 53559),
  "Germany", 53499,
  "Spain", 53502,
  "Italy", 54890,
  "Sweden", 56336,
)
saveRDS(league_ids, "league_ids.rds")
```
